Graphic User Interface (GUI) is a visual way of interacting with a computer through the use of menus, censors, tabs, windows, icons and more. This is used by most modern operating systems. The use of Icons makes it easier to interact through clickable graphic icons. Downsides of GUI are that it requires more RAM and processing power and is not resource optimized. However GUI gives users access to computers remotely. Command Line Interface (CLI) is a text based user interface used to interact with your computer, run programs and manage files. Downsides to CLI is itâ€™s small room for error and large number of commands that make it difficult to learn. Personally I am more interested in GUI, as it is more popular in today's creative coding world and is more enjoyable and easier to navigate than CLI.
